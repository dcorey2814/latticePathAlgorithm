# latticePathAlgorithm
This is a polymake program that implements Mikhalkin's lattice path algorithm, and part of the paper [Counting tropical curves in P1 x P1 : computation and polynomiality properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11097) with Hannah Markwig and Dhruv Ranganathan, which is in preparation.
